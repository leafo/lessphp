test.php
========================================

to run:
	php test.php [test-name-glob]


Runs through all files in `inputs`, compiles them, then
compares to respective file in `outputs`. If there are
any differences then the test will fail.

Add the -d flag to show the differences of failed tests
in your diff tool (currently assigned in code, $difftool)
Defaults to diff, but I like using meld.

Pass the -C flag to save the output of the inputs to
the appropriate file. This will overwrite any existing
outputs. Use this when you want to save verified test
results.

You can also run specific tests by passing in an argument 
that contains any part of the test name.
